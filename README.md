## Overview

Press Start aims at providing a starting point for Data Science projects, by
running initial tests and preliminary experiments to generate insights
regarding the problem.

## How to use

Press Start uses Kedro as central framework, which allows us to execute the
steps in the project selectively.

In order to use `press-start` for your own project, clone this repository:

```bash
git@github.com:luizvbo/press-start.git
